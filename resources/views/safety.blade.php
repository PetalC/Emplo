                    Schools advertising on Employo do not require your bank account details at the time of application,
                    or ahead of interviewing or commencing.  Payroll setup is a secure process handled by the schools
                    hiring you. It is normally done on your first day(s) on the job in the school.  At no time is it common
                    for an employer to call, text or email you for your bank details.

                    <span class="font-semibold">Money Transfers</span> Employo does not run payroll for candidates who secure work through our
                    recruitment service or online platform.  Teachers are paid by the school or authority governing the

                    or any such finance incentive ahead of commencing and performing work.  Any request do to so is
                    likely to access your bank details and is a scam.
